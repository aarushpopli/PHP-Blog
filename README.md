# PHP-Blog
This responsive blogging website was made using PHP. Users can see the blogs posted by me. They can comment on it and share it. Users can see related posts in the same category and can also search for blogs based on the title. There is an admin panel that makes it easy for me to add, edit or delete posts. I can also add categories using the admin panel.
